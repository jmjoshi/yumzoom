# Restaurant Characteristics Rating System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**

The Restaurant Characteristics Rating System provides detailed, granular feedback on restaurant experiences through an 8-category rating system using 1-10 star ratings. This feature enhances the traditional overall rating approach by breaking down the dining experience into specific characteristics that matter most to families and diners.

## ⭐ **Rating Categories**

The system implements the following 8 rating categories:

1. **Ambience** - Overall atmosphere and mood of the restaurant
2. **Decor** - Interior design, aesthetics, and visual appeal
3. **Service** - Staff attentiveness, friendliness, and professionalism
4. **Cleanliness** - Hygiene standards of dining area, restrooms, and facilities
5. **Noise Level** - Acoustic environment and conversation comfort
6. **Value for Money** - Price-to-quality ratio and portion sizing
7. **Food Quality** - Taste, presentation, and preparation excellence
8. **Overall Rating** - Comprehensive experience assessment
