GitHub Copilot: The error you're encountering is because the script is trying to execute SQL statements via PostgREST's RPC functionality by calling a PostgreSQL function named `exec`, but this function doesn't exist in your database.

Here's what's happening:

1. The script is using `supabase.rpc('exec', { sql: statement })` to try to execute SQL
2. PostgREST translates this to calling the PostgreSQL function `public.exec(query)`
3. This function doesn't exist, causing the PGRST202 error

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Run SQL Manually in Supabase (Recommended)
Since you're using Supabase, the safest approach is to run the SQL directly in the Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of content-versioning-schema.sql
4. Click "Run" to execute
5. Then copy and paste the contents of content-versioning-triggers.sql
6. Click "Run" to execute

### Option 2: Create the exec Function (Not Recommended for Production)
If you must execute SQL programmatically, you could create an `exec` function, but this is potentially dangerous:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION exec(sql text)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  EXECUTE sql;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This gives anyone with database access the ability to execute arbitrary SQL. Only use this with proper security measures and the service role key.

### Option 3: Use Supabase CLI
If you have the Supabase CLI installed, you can use it to run migrations locally.

The current setup-content-versioning.js script is designed to just show instructions (as I can see from reading it), so if you're getting execution errors, you might be running a different or modified version of the script.

I'd recommend **Option 1** - running the SQL manually in your Supabase dashboard, as it's the safest and most reliable method for schema changes.

Perfect! I've successfully implemented a comprehensive feature flag system for your YumZoom application. Here's what I've created:

## üéØ **Complete Feature Flag System**

### **Database Schema** (feature-flags-schema.sql)
- **feature_flags**: Main table for feature definitions
- **feature_flag_overrides**: User-specific overrides
- **feature_flag_usage**: Usage tracking
- **feature_flag_audit_log**: Complete change history
- **Database functions**: For checking, creating, updating features

### **API Endpoints**
- `GET/POST /api/feature-flags` - Manage feature flags
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/feature-flags/[id]` - Individual feature management
- `GET/POST /api/feature-flags/check` - Check feature status

### **Client-Side Tools**
- **React Hook**: `useFeatureFlag()` for individual features
- **React Hook**: `useFeatureFlags()` for multiple features
- **Component**: `<FeatureFlag>` for conditional rendering
- **HOC**: `withFeatureFlag()` for component-level gating
- **Utility**: `checkFeatureFlag()` for server-side checks

### **Admin Dashboard**
- Complete UI at `/admin/feature-flags`
- Toggle features on/off instantly
- Adjust rollout percentages
- Create/edit/delete features
- View usage analytics

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

1. **Set up the database**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-feature-flags.js
   ```

2. **Test the system**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-feature-flags.js
   ```

3. **Access admin dashboard**:
   Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin/feature-flags`

## üí° **Usage Examples**

### **Simple Feature Gating**
```tsx
import { FeatureFlag } from '@/components/feature-flags/FeatureFlag';

<FeatureFlag 
  feature="social_features"
  fallback={<p>Social features coming soon!</p>}
>
  <SocialFeatures />
</FeatureFlag>
```

### **Hook-Based Logic**
```tsx
import { useFeatureFlag } from '@/hooks/useFeatureFlags';

const { enabled } = useFeatureFlag('gamification');
if (enabled) {
  // Show gamification features
}
```

### **Multiple Features**
```tsx
import { useFeatureFlags } from '@/hooks/useFeatureFlags';

const { features } = useFeatureFlags(['social', 'gamification', 'analytics']);
```

## üéõÔ∏è **Key Features**

‚úÖ **Dynamic Control**: Enable/disable features without code changes  
‚úÖ **Gradual Rollouts**: Percentage-based user targeting  
‚úÖ **User Overrides**: Individual user feature access  
‚úÖ **Usage Tracking**: Monitor feature adoption  
‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Complete change history  
‚úÖ **Admin UI**: User-friendly management interface  
‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support  
‚úÖ **Performance**: Efficient caching and checks  

## üìö **Documentation**

I've created comprehensive documentation in FEATURE_FLAGS_README.md with:
- Complete API reference
- Usage examples
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide
- Migration strategies

## üîß **Default Features Included**

The system comes pre-configured with 8 features:
- `social_features` - Social networking capabilities
- `gamification` - Points, badges, achievements
- `advanced_analytics` - Detailed analytics dashboard
- `content_versioning` - Version control for content
- `accessibility_features` - Enhanced accessibility
- `future_tech` - AR, VR, AI features
- `moderation_tools` - Content moderation
- `business_platform` - Restaurant business tools

## üéâ **Ready to Use!**

Your feature flag system is now ready. You can:
1. Run the setup script to create the database schema
2. Visit the admin dashboard to manage features
3. Start using feature flags in your components
4. Gradually roll out new features to users

The system is production-ready and includes proper error handling, security measures, and performance optimizations. You now have complete control over feature deployment without requiring code changes or redeployments!
