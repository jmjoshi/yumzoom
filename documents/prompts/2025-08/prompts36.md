Now let me search for performance and scalability implementations: Now let me check for performance metrics and query optimization: Now let me run a build check to verify TypeScript compilation: There's a TypeScript compilation error in the LocationPicker component. Let me fix it first: I can see the error - there's a syntax issue with the dynamic import. Let me fix it: 
```


Made changes.

Now let me run the build again to verify no TypeScript errors: Let me fix the undefined rating issue: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me run the build again: Let me fix the menuQuery.order issue: I need to see more context around the searchMenuItems function to fix this properly: The issue is that `searchMenuItems` returns a function that builds a query, but we're treating it as if it returns a query builder directly. Let me look at how `searchMenuItems` is defined: Let me find the actual definition of `searchMenuItems`: I see the issue. `searchMenuItems` is an async function, but it's being used as if it returns a query builder. Let me find where it's actually called and fix the issue: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me run the build again: Let me fix the URLSearchParams issue: The issue is that URLSearchParams constructor expects string values, but we might have numbers. Let me fix this: 
```


Made changes.


```
I need to fix all instances of this issue. Let me fix the next one too: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me run the build again: Let me fix the family analytics issue: Let me see the data structure being returned to understand the issue: I can see the issue. The data structure shows that menu_items is an array, but the code is trying to access it as a single object. Let me fix this:

GitHub Copilot: You have exceeded your premium request allowance. We have automatically switched you to GPT-4.1 which is included with your plan. [Enable additional paid premium requests](command:chat.enablePremiumOverages) to continue using premium models.I am unable to apply the fix directly because file editing is currently disabled. Please enable file editing, or let me know if you want the code fix as a snippet to apply manually. 

Here is the fix for your reference:

```tsx
// Replace this block:
const uniqueRestaurants = new Set(ratings.map(r => r.menu_items?.restaurants?.id));
const totalRestaurants = uniqueRestaurants.size;

// With this:
const uniqueRestaurants = new Set(
  ratings
    .map(r => r.menu_items?.[0]?.restaurants?.[0]?.id)
    .filter(Boolean)
);
const totalRestaurants = uniqueRestaurants.size;

// And for estimatedSpending:
const estimatedSpending = ratings.reduce((sum, r) => {
  const price = r.menu_items?.[0]?.price || 0;
  return sum + Number(price);
}, 0);
```

Let me know if you want to continue with checkbox updates or need further help!

jmjoshi: I see errors in file hooks/useFamilyAnalytics.tsx

GitHub Copilot: You have exceeded your premium request allowance. We have automatically switched you to GPT-4.1 which is included with your plan. [Enable additional paid premium requests](command:chat.enablePremiumOverages) to continue using premium models.Summarized conversation historyThe most likely source of TypeScript errors in useFamilyAnalytics.tsx is the way nested properties are accessed from Supabase query results, especially for `menu_items` and `restaurants`. Supabase returns arrays for joined tables, so you should access them as arrays (e.g., `menu_items?.[0]?.restaurants?.[0]?.id`).

**Key fixes needed:**
- In `fetchFamilyInsights`, change all property accesses like `r.menu_items?.restaurants?.[0]?.id` to use array indexing.
- In `fetchPopularRestaurants`, change `const restaurant = rating.menu_items?.restaurants;` to `const restaurant = rating.menu_items?.[0]?.restaurants?.[0];` and update all subsequent property accesses accordingly.
- In `fetchCuisinePreferences`, change `rating.menu_items?.restaurants?.cuisine_type` to `rating.menu_items?.[0]?.restaurants?.[0]?.cuisine_type`.
- In `fetchMemberActivity`, change `rating.menu_items?.restaurants?.name` and `rating.menu_items?.restaurants?.cuisine_type` to use array indexing.

I will apply these fixes to resolve the TypeScript errors. 
```


Made changes.


```
There is still a TypeScript error in useFamilyAnalytics.tsx at this line:
```ts
const activeMembers = new Set(ratings.map(r => r.family_members?.id).filter(Boolean));
```
The error says: `Property 'id' does not exist on type '{ id: any; name: any; }[]'.`

**Reason:**  
Supabase returns `family_members` as an array, so you need to access the first element:  
Change to:
```ts
const activeMembers = new Set(ratings.map(r => r.family_members?.[0]?.id).filter(Boolean));
```

I will apply this fix now. 
```


Made changes.


```
All TypeScript compilation errors in useFamilyAnalytics.tsx are now resolved. The build completed with only runtime/static generation warnings and not type errors.

**Next step:**  
I will update the "Zero TypeScript compilation errors" checkbox in the Technical Infrastructure section of `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md` to `[x]` (verified). Let me proceed with this update. 
```


Made changes.


```
The TypeScript errors in useFamilyAnalytics.tsx are fully resolved, and the build now passes without compilation errors.  
The "Zero TypeScript compilation errors" checkbox in the Technical Infrastructure section of PRODUCTION_READINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md is now checked and verified.
