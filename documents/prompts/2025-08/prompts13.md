This implementation successfully delivers all requirements from the feature roadmap and provides a solid foundation for future integration enhancements!

jmjoshi: I see one problem in integrations.ts file under lib folder in vs code

GitHub Copilot: I can see you're looking at the integrations.ts file. Let me examine the current file to identify any issues: I can see the issue! The problem is in the import statement at the top of the file. It's trying to import `Restaurant` from `@/types`, but based on our earlier work, the Restaurant type is actually in `@/types/restaurant`. Let me fix this: 
```


Made changes.


```
I see the issues! The Restaurant type doesn't have some of the properties we're trying to use. Let me check the actual Restaurant type definition and fix the code accordingly: Now I understand the issue. The Restaurant type has `rating` instead of `average_rating`, and doesn't have `city` or `state` properties. Let me fix these type mismatches: 
```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```
Perfect! I've fixed all the TypeScript errors in the integrations.ts file. The issues were:

## üêõ **Problems Fixed:**

1. **Import Path Issue**: Changed `import { Restaurant } from '@/types'` to `import { Restaurant } from '@/types/restaurant'`

2. **Property Name Mismatch**: 
   - Changed `restaurant.average_rating` to `restaurant.rating` (with fallback to 'N/A')
   - The Restaurant type uses `rating` not `average_rating`

3. **Missing Properties**: 
   - Removed references to `restaurant.city` and `restaurant.state` (these don't exist in the Restaurant type)
   - Updated calendar event location to use just `restaurant.address`
   - Updated delivery deep link to use `restaurant.address` or fallback to `restaurant.name`

4. **Optional Property Handling**:
   - Added null checks for `restaurant.cuisine_type` using optional chaining and fallbacks
   - Made the code more robust against undefined properties

## ‚úÖ **Changes Made:**

- **Calendar Event**: Now uses `restaurant.rating` and handles missing location data gracefully
- **Share Content**: Properly handles optional cuisine type and removes city references  
- **Delivery Links**: Uses available address information without assuming city/state fields
- **Type Safety**: All functions now properly handle the actual Restaurant interface structure

The file should now compile without any TypeScript errors and work correctly with your existing Restaurant data structure!

jmjoshi: I see some problems in files CalendarIntegration.tsx and SocialSharing.tsx in vs code

GitHub Copilot: Let me examine both files to identify the issues you're seeing in VS Code. I can see the issues! Both files are referencing `restaurant.city` which doesn't exist in the Restaurant type. Let me fix these TypeScript errors.

## Fix CalendarIntegration.tsx 
```


Made changes.


```
## Fix SocialSharing.tsx 
```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```
Now let me check if there are any other errors in these files: Perfect! I've fixed all the TypeScript errors in both files. Let me also check if there's a missing component that might be needed: I notice that `ReservationIntegration` is imported but we haven't created that component yet. Let me create it: It seems the file already exists. Let me check if it has errors: Great! Let me also check the IntegrationHub file for any remaining errors: Perfect! Now let me commit the fixes for the TypeScript errors: ## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed Successfully!**

I've identified and resolved all the TypeScript errors in both `CalendarIntegration.tsx` and `SocialSharing.tsx`:

### **Problems Found & Fixed:**

1. **‚ùå `restaurant.city` Property Missing**
   - **Issue**: Both components were trying to access `restaurant.city` which doesn't exist in the Restaurant type
   - **Fix**: Removed city references and used only available properties

2. **‚ùå Optional Properties Not Handled**
   - **Issue**: `restaurant.cuisine_type` is optional but was used without null checks
   - **Fix**: Added fallbacks using `||` operator

### **Specific Changes Made:**

**In CalendarIntegration.tsx:**
```tsx
// Before (ERROR):
<span>{restaurant.name} - {restaurant.address}, {restaurant.city}</span>

// After (FIXED):
<span>{restaurant.name} - {restaurant.address}</span>
```

**In SocialSharing.tsx:**
```tsx
// Before (ERROR):
return `Just rated ${restaurant.name} ${rating}/10 on YumZoom! Great ${restaurant.cuisine_type} food in ${restaurant.city}.`;

// After (FIXED):
return `Just rated ${restaurant.name} ${rating}/10 on YumZoom! Great ${restaurant.cuisine_type || 'food'} experience.`;
```

```tsx
// Before (ERROR):
<strong>{restaurant.name}</strong> - {restaurant.cuisine_type} in {restaurant.city}

// After (FIXED):
<strong>{restaurant.name}</strong> - {restaurant.cuisine_type || 'Restaurant'}
```

### **All Components Now Error-Free:**
- ‚úÖ CalendarIntegration.tsx
- ‚úÖ SocialSharing.tsx  
- ‚úÖ ReservationIntegration.tsx
- ‚úÖ DeliveryIntegration.tsx
- ‚úÖ IntegrationHub.tsx

The fixes have been committed and pushed to your GitHub repository. Your integration components should now compile without any TypeScript errors in VS Code! üéâ
