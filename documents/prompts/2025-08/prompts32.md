jmjoshi: create subfolders under documents folder based on the category of documents and move all the documents to respective subfolders under documents directory

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you organize the documents in the documents folder by creating subfolders based on document categories and moving the files accordingly. Let me first explore the current structure and examine the documents to understand their categories. Now let me check what's currently in the documents folder: Based on the document structure, I can see there are documents both in the root directory and in the documents folder. Let me analyze the naming patterns to categorize them properly. I'll create subfolders based on the document categories I can identify:

1. **business** - Business guides and operational documents
2. **technical** - Technical documentation, architecture, API docs
3. **deployment** - Production deployment guides and deployment-related docs
4. **compliance** - Legal compliance, security, and regulatory documents
5. **features** - Feature analysis, implementation summaries, and roadmaps
6. **testing** - Testing guides and documentation
7. **fixes** - Bug fixes, error resolution summaries
8. **guides** - Setup guides, tutorials, and user manuals
9. **prompts** - All the prompt files
10. **implementation** - Implementation summaries and specific feature implementations

Let me create these subfolders first: Now let me move the documents from the root directory to the appropriate subfolders in the documents directory. I'll start by moving documents from the root directory: Now let me move the documents that are currently in the documents folder to the appropriate subfolders:

jmjoshi: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

GitHub Copilot: Let me check what files are still in the main documents directory: Let me move the remaining files to appropriate subfolders: Now let me check the final structure to see what we have organized: Let me move the remaining general documents: Let me check what's in each subfolder to verify the organization: Let me check the other subfolders as well: Finally, let me check the current state of the documents directory: Perfect! I've successfully organized all the documents in the documents folder into categorized subfolders. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Document Organization Complete ‚úÖ

I've created 10 subfolders under the documents directory and moved all relevant documents from both the root directory and the existing documents folder into appropriate categories:

### üìÅ **Subfolder Structure Created:**

1. **`business/`** - Business guides and operational documents
   - All BUSINESS_GUIDE_PART_*.md files (5 files)

2. **`technical/`** - Technical documentation, architecture, and API docs
   - All TECHNICAL_*.md files (13 files including API, database, security, etc.)

3. **`deployment/`** - Production deployment guides and deployment-related docs
   - All PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_*.md files and deployment documentation (8 files)

4. **`compliance/`** - Legal compliance, security, and regulatory documents
   - Legal compliance checklist, RBAC, security files, compliance reports (4 files)

5. **`features/`** - Feature analysis, implementation summaries, and roadmaps
   - Feature roadmap, unimplemented features analysis, comprehensive feature docs (10 files)

6. **`testing/`** - Testing guides and documentation
   - Testing guides for restaurant setup, characteristics, and comprehensive testing (3 files)

7. **`fixes/`** - Bug fixes, error resolution summaries
   - TypeScript fixes, console errors, RBAC fixes, security fixes (10 files)

8. **`guides/`** - Setup guides, tutorials, and user manuals
   - Quick start guide, FAQ, feature tutorials, user manual, setup instructions (6 files)

9. **`prompts/`** - All prompt files
   - All prompt*.md files and Prompts.md (30+ files)

10. **`implementation/`** - Implementation summaries and specific feature implementations
    - All *IMPLEMENTATION*.md files for various features (19 files)

### üìÑ **Remaining Files:**
- README.md - Left in the main documents directory as it serves as the main documentation entry point
- `requirements/` - Existing subdirectory left in place

The documents are now well-organized by category, making it much easier to navigate and find specific types of documentation. Each subfolder contains related documents that serve similar purposes or cover similar topics.

jmjoshi: chech in the changes and updates in github repository with list of components added, updated and features list

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you check in the changes to the GitHub repository with a comprehensive commit message listing all the organizational changes made. Let me first check the current git status to see what changes need to be committed. Now I'll add all the changes to git staging area: Let me check the git status again to confirm all changes are staged: Perfect! Now I'll create a comprehensive commit message and commit the changes: Excellent! The commit was successful. Now let me push the changes to the GitHub repository: Let me check the git status to confirm everything is pushed: Perfect! Let me also check the git log to confirm our commit is there: ## ‚úÖ GitHub Repository Successfully Updated!
