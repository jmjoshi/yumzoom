# Console Errors Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Multiple GoTrueClient Instances Warning
**Problem**: Multiple Supabase client instances were being created, causing warnings about concurrent usage.
**Solution**: 
- Modified `SecretsManager` to cache client instances
- Added unique storage keys for different client types
- Implemented singleton pattern in `lib/supabase.ts`

### 2. Manifest.json Syntax Error
**Problem**: Line 71 had an unexpected token due to malformed JSON structure.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed the duplicate `"shortcuts"` key in `public/manifest.json`
- Properly closed the array and object structure

### 3. 404 Errors for Restaurant Owner APIs
**Problem**: `useRestaurantOwner` hook was making requests without proper authentication headers.
**Solution**: 
- Added authentication headers using Supabase session tokens
- Added proper error handling for 404s (endpoint not found)
- Added retry mechanism with maximum retry limits
- Added graceful degradation when endpoints are not available

### 4. React DevTools Warning
**Problem**: Development-only warning about React DevTools download.
**Solution**: 
- Created console filter (`lib/console-filter.ts`) to suppress known non-critical warnings
- Added webpack configuration to use React profiling builds in development

## Additional Improvements

### 5. Error Boundary
- Added `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and handle React errors gracefully
- Wrapped main application content in error boundary for better UX

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- Added debounce mechanism to prevent rapid API calls
- Implemented retry limits to prevent infinite failed requests
- Optimized Supabase client initialization

### 7. Environment Handling
- Added better environment variable validation
- Limited key validation schedule to production only
- Added development-specific configurations

## Files Modified

1. `lib/secrets.ts` - Client caching and optimization
2. `lib/supabase.ts` - Singleton pattern implementation
3. `public/manifest.json` - Fixed JSON syntax error
4. `hooks/useRestaurantOwner.tsx` - Added auth headers and error handling
5. `app/layout.tsx` - Added ErrorBoundary and console filter
6. `next.config.js` - Added webpack config for React DevTools
7. `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - New error boundary component
8. `lib/console-filter.ts` - New console warning filter

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ Multiple GoTrueClient warnings should be eliminated
- ✅ Manifest.json errors should be resolved
- ✅ 404 API errors should be handled gracefully without spam
- ✅ React DevTools warning should be suppressed in development
- ✅ Better error handling and user experience
- ✅ Improved performance with reduced unnecessary API calls

## Testing Recommendations

1. Clear browser cache and refresh the application
2. Check browser console for reduced error messages
3. Test offline/online scenarios
4. Verify PWA functionality still works
5. Test authentication flows
6. Monitor network requests to ensure they're not spamming

## Notes

- The console filter only runs in development mode
- Error boundary provides fallback UI for React errors
- API retry mechanisms prevent infinite loops
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
