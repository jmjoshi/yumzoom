## Technical Specifications

### Database Tables

#### restaurant_owners
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- restaurant_id (uuid, references restaurants)
- business_name (text)
- business_email (text)
- business_phone (text)
- verification_documents (jsonb)
- verification_status (enum: pending, verified, rejected)
- verification_notes (text)
- is_verified (boolean)
- created_at (timestamptz)
- updated_at (timestamptz)
```

#### review_responses
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- restaurant_owner_id (uuid, references restaurant_owners)
- rating_id (uuid, references ratings)
- response_text (text)
- is_edited (boolean)
- edited_at (timestamptz)
- is_deleted (boolean)
- created_at (timestamptz)
- updated_at (timestamptz)
```

#### response_notifications
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- rating_id (uuid, references ratings)
- response_id (uuid, references review_responses)
- notification_type (enum: new_response, response_edited)
- is_read (boolean)
- read_at (timestamptz)
- created_at (timestamptz)
```

### Authentication Pattern
All API routes use the existing project authentication pattern:
```typescript
// Get user from auth header
const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization');
const token = authHeader?.replace('Bearer ', '');
const { data: { user }, error: authError } = await supabase.auth.getUser(token);

// Database operations use supabaseAdmin for RLS bypass
const { data } = await supabaseAdmin.from('table_name')...
```

### Security Features
- **RLS Policies**: Users can only access their own data
- **Owner Verification**: Only verified owners can respond to reviews
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all forms
- **Rate Limiting**: Built into Supabase infrastructure
- **Audit Trail**: Full tracking of response edits and deletions

## Key Features

### Restaurant Owner Verification

- Document upload capability (business license, tax ID, etc.)
- Admin review workflow (pending/verified/rejected states)
- Professional verification status display

### Review Response System

- Edit existing responses with edit tracking
- Delete responses (soft delete for audit trail)
- Professional response guidelines and best practices

- Unread count in navbar notification bell
- Mark individual or bulk notifications as read
- Rich notification content with review context

### Dashboard Analytics
- Total reviews and responses count
