## 📋 **BACKLOG - TEMPORARILY DISABLED FEATURES**

### Social Features - Collaboration Sessions (TEMPORARILY DISABLED)
**Status:** Disabled due to infinite recursion in RLS policies  
**Original Implementation:** Completed but experiencing database policy conflicts  
**Issue:** Circular Row Level Security (RLS) policy dependencies causing infinite recursion  
**Timeline for Re-enablement:** 1-2 days

#### Affected Features:
- **Family Collaboration Sessions** - Group decision making for restaurant selection
  - Create dining decision sessions with multiple participants
  - Real-time voting on restaurant options
  - Session management and status tracking
  - Winner determination based on voting results

- **Collaboration Participants Management** - User and family member participation
  - Add family members and connected users to sessions
  - Track participation status and engagement
  - Manage participant permissions and roles

- **Collaboration Options & Voting** - Restaurant option management and voting system
  - Add restaurant suggestions to collaboration sessions
  - Vote on preferred dining options
  - Real-time vote counting and result calculation
  - Vote history and user voting patterns

#### Technical Details:
- **Root Cause:** Complex RLS policies with circular table references between `family_collaboration_sessions`, `collaboration_participants`, `collaboration_options`, and `collaboration_votes`
- **Current Workaround:** Collaboration queries disabled in `useSocial.tsx` hook
- **Required Fix:** Simplify RLS policies to eliminate circular dependencies
- **Database Tables Affected:**
  - `family_collaboration_sessions`
  - `collaboration_participants`
  - `collaboration_options`
  - `collaboration_votes`

#### Recovery Plan:
1. **Phase 1 (Immediate - 30 minutes):** Implement simple RLS policies without circular references
2. **Phase 2 (1-2 hours):** Test collaboration features with simplified security model
3. **Phase 3 (Optional - 2-4 hours):** Redesign RLS policies for production-grade security while maintaining functionality

#### Impact on User Experience:
- ✅ **Working:** All other social features (connections, recommendations, activity feed)
- ❌ **Disabled:** Group decision-making tools and collaboration workflows
- 🔄 **Workaround:** Users can still share recommendations individually through the friend recommendation system

#### Priority for Re-enablement:
**High Priority** - These features are core to YumZoom's family collaboration value proposition and should be restored as soon as the RLS policy issues are resolved.
