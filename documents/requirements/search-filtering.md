## Search & Filtering Functionality Requirements

The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements for the search and filtering functionality

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FR-SEARCH-RESTAURANT-001** | Restaurant Name Search | As a user, I want to search for restaurants by name, so that I can quickly find specific establishments I'm looking for. | The system should provide a search input field on the restaurants page that filters restaurants in real-time as the user types. Search should be case-insensitive and support partial matches. Results should update immediately without page reload. |
| **FR-SEARCH-RESTAURANT-002** | Cuisine Type Filtering | As a user, I want to filter restaurants by cuisine type, so that I can discover restaurants serving my preferred food styles. | The system should provide a dropdown filter for cuisine types with options like Italian, Chinese, Mexican, etc. Users should be able to select multiple cuisine types. The filter should work in combination with text search. |
| **FR-SEARCH-RESTAURANT-003** | Location-Based Search | As a user, I want to search for restaurants by location or address, so that I can find dining options near specific areas. | The system should allow searching by city, neighborhood, or street address. Search should match against the restaurant's address field and provide relevant results. Future enhancement should include geolocation-based "near me" functionality. |
| **FR-SEARCH-MENU-001** | Menu Item Search | As a user, I want to search for specific dishes across all restaurants, so that I can find where my favorite foods are available. | The system should provide a global menu item search that looks across all restaurants' menu items. Search results should show the dish name, restaurant name, price, and rating. Users should be able to navigate directly to the restaurant page from search results. |
| **FR-SEARCH-MENU-002** | Category Filtering | As a user, I want to filter menu items by category (appetizers, mains, desserts), so that I can browse specific types of dishes. | The system should provide category filters on menu item search results. Categories should match the admin-defined menu categories. Users should be able to select multiple categories simultaneously. |
| **FR-FILTER-PRICE-001** | Price Range Filtering | As a user, I want to filter restaurants and menu items by price range, so that I can find options that fit my budget. | The system should provide price range sliders or input fields for minimum and maximum price. For restaurants, this should filter based on average menu item prices. For menu items, this should filter based on individual item prices. |
| **FR-FILTER-RATING-001** | Rating-Based Filtering | As a user, I want to filter restaurants and menu items by rating, so that I can find highly-rated options. | The system should provide rating filters (e.g., 4+ stars, 8+ rating) for both restaurants and menu items. Filtering should be based on average ratings calculated from user reviews. |
| **FR-FILTER-DIETARY-001** | Dietary Restrictions Filtering | As a user, I want to filter menu items by dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), so that I can find suitable food options. | The system should provide dietary restriction filters with common options. This requires adding dietary restriction fields to menu items in the admin interface. Filters should clearly indicate when dietary information is not available. |
| **FR-SEARCH-ADVANCED-001** | Advanced Search Interface | As a user, I want to access advanced search options through an expandable interface, so that I can perform complex searches without cluttering the main interface. | The system should provide an "Advanced Search" toggle that expands to show additional filters. Basic search (name/cuisine) should be visible by default. Advanced options should include location, price, rating, and dietary filters. |
| **FR-SEARCH-RESULTS-001** | Search Results Display | As a user, I want search results to be clearly displayed with relevant information, so that I can make informed decisions about restaurants and dishes. | Search results should show restaurant cards or menu item cards with key information (name, rating, price, location). Results should indicate which search criteria matched. Pagination or infinite scroll should be implemented for large result sets. |
| **FR-SEARCH-PERSISTENCE-001** | Search State Persistence | As a user, I want my search filters to persist when I navigate back to search results, so that I don't lose my search criteria. | The system should maintain search filters and results in the browser session. URL parameters should reflect current search state for shareable links. Search history should be maintained for the current session. |
| **FR-SEARCH-MOBILE-001** | Mobile Search Experience | As a mobile user, I want an optimized search interface that works well on small screens, so that I can efficiently search for restaurants and menu items. | The search interface should be fully responsive with touch-friendly controls. Filters should be accessible through collapsible sections or modal interfaces on mobile. Search input should have appropriate mobile keyboard types. |

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Requirements
- **Add search indexes**: Full-text search indexes on restaurant names and menu item names
- **Dietary restrictions**: Add dietary_restrictions JSON field to menu_items table
- **Location indexing**: Consider adding latitude/longitude fields for future geolocation features
- **Search analytics**: Optional table to track popular search terms

### Search Implementation Strategy
- **Client-side filtering**: For small datasets, implement real-time filtering in React
- **Server-side search**: For larger datasets, implement API endpoints with search parameters
- **Full-text search**: Use PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities through Supabase
- **Debounced search**: Implement debouncing to avoid excessive API calls during typing

### Performance Considerations
- **Search indexing**: Proper database indexes for search columns
- **Result caching**: Cache popular search results for better performance
- **Progressive loading**: Load search results progressively to improve perceived performance
- **Search optimization**: Optimize queries to return results within 500ms

### User Experience Requirements
- **Auto-complete**: Implement search suggestions based on popular restaurants/dishes
- **Search highlighting**: Highlight matched terms in search results
- **Empty states**: Provide helpful messages when no results are found
- **Filter indicators**: Show active filters and easy removal options
- **Responsive design**: Ensure search works well on all device sizes

### Future Enhancements
- **Geolocation search**: "Restaurants near me" functionality
- **Voice search**: Voice input for search queries
- **Search analytics**: Track and analyze user search behavior
- **AI recommendations**: Machine learning-based search result ranking
- **Saved searches**: Allow users to save and revisit favorite search criteria

### Integration Requirements
- **Family preferences**: Consider family member dietary restrictions in search results
- **Rating integration**: Use family member ratings for search result ranking
- **Admin content**: New restaurants and menu items immediately searchable
- **Mobile app**: Search functionality compatible with PWA implementation
