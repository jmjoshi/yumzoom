| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FR-REVIEW-WRITTEN-001** | Written Review Creation | As a family member, I want to write detailed reviews alongside my ratings, so that I can share specific experiences and help other families make informed decisions. | The system should provide a text area for written reviews when rating restaurants or menu items. Reviews should support up to 500 characters with real-time character count. Reviews should be optional but encouraged. |
| **FR-REVIEW-WRITTEN-002** | Review Display and Reading | As a user, I want to read written reviews from other families, so that I can get detailed insights about restaurants and menu items beyond just ratings. | The system should display written reviews on restaurant and menu item pages.

| **FR-REVIEW-WRITTEN-003** | Review Editing and Management | As a family member, I want to edit or delete my reviews, so that I can update my opinions or correct mistakes. | The system should allow review authors to edit their reviews within 24 hours of posting or delete them at any time. Edited reviews should show an "edited" timestamp. Deleted reviews should be soft-deleted to maintain referential integrity. |
| **FR-REVIEW-PHOTO-001** | Photo Upload with Reviews | As a family member, I want to upload photos of food and restaurant ambiance with my reviews, so that I can visually share my dining experience. | The system should allow uploading up to 3 photos per review.

Implement automated checks for inappropriate content where possible. Provide user reporting functionality for inappropriate photos. |
| **FR-REVIEW-HELPFUL-001** | Review Helpfulness Voting | As a user, I want to mark reviews as helpful or not helpful, so that the most useful reviews can be highlighted for other families. | The system should provide "helpful" and "not helpful" buttons on reviews. Display helpfulness scores and sort reviews by helpfulness as an option. Users can only vote once per review and cannot vote on their own reviews. |
| **FR-REVIEW-HELPFUL-002** | Helpful Review Promotion | As a user, I want to see the most helpful reviews first, so that I can quickly access the most valuable insights from other families. | The system should offer sorting options for reviews including "most helpful," "newest," "highest rating," and "lowest rating." Most helpful reviews should be prominently displayed by default. |
| **FR-REVIEW-RESPONSE-001** | Restaurant Owner Responses | As a restaurant owner, I want to respond to reviews about my restaurant, so that I can address concerns, thank customers, and show engagement with feedback. | The system should allow verified restaurant owners to post public responses to reviews. Responses should be clearly marked as from the restaurant owner. One response per review with editing capabilities. |
| **FR-REVIEW-RESPONSE-002** | Response Notification System | As a family member, I want to be notified when a restaurant owner responds to my review, so that I can see their engagement and any addressed concerns. | The system should send notifications (email and in-app) when restaurant owners respond to reviews. Include the response content and a link to view the full conversation on the restaurant page. |
| **FR-REVIEW-REPORTING-001** | Review Reporting and Moderation | As a user, I want to report inappropriate or fake reviews, so that the platform maintains quality and trustworthiness. | The system should provide a "report review" option with categories like "inappropriate content," "fake review," "spam," etc. Include a brief explanation field and admin review workflow for reported content. |
| **FR-REVIEW-VERIFICATION-001** | Review Authenticity Verification | As a user, I want confidence that reviews are from real families who actually visited the restaurant, so that I can trust the feedback I'm reading. | The system should implement review verification mechanisms such as visit confirmation, photo requirements for high ratings, or review pattern analysis to identify suspicious activity. Display verification indicators on trusted reviews. |
| **FR-REVIEW-FILTERING-001** | Review Filtering Options | As a user, I want to filter reviews by various criteria, so that I can find the most relevant feedback for my needs. | The system should provide filters for reviews by rating range, date range, family type (size, preferences), review length, and presence of photos. Include quick filter buttons for common selections like "recent reviews" or "with photos." |
| **FR-REVIEW-STATISTICS-001** | Review Summary Statistics | As a user, I want to see review statistics for restaurants and menu items, so that I can quickly understand the overall consensus. | The system should display review summary statistics including total review count, average rating, rating distribution chart, percentage with photos, and most common keywords or themes from written reviews. |
| **FR-REVIEW-TEMPLATES-001** | Review Writing Assistance | As a family member, I want guidance on writing helpful reviews, so that I can provide valuable feedback to other families. | The system should provide optional review templates or prompts like "Tell us about the food quality," "How was the service?" "What did your family enjoy most?" Include tips for writing helpful reviews. |
| **FR-REVIEW-PRIVACY-001** | Review Privacy Controls | As a family member, I want control over my review privacy, so that I can choose how much personal information is shared with my reviews. | The system should allow families to choose display options: full family name, first name only, or anonymous (with verification). Include options to hide family member details while keeping review visible. |
| **FR-REVIEW-AGGREGATE-001** | Cross-Platform Review Aggregation | As a user, I want to see how YumZoom reviews compare with other review platforms, so that I can get a comprehensive view of restaurant quality. | The system should optionally display aggregated ratings from other platforms (Google, Yelp) for comparison alongside YumZoom family reviews. Clearly distinguish between platform sources and highlight YumZoom's family-focused perspective. |
| **FR-REVIEW-MOBILE-001** | Mobile Review Experience | As a mobile user, I want to easily write and read reviews on my mobile device, so that I can share experiences immediately after dining. | The system should provide an optimized mobile interface for review creation with easy photo capture, voice-to-text input support, and touch-friendly rating controls. Reading reviews should be optimized for mobile scrolling and interaction. |
| **FR-REVIEW-TRENDING-001** | Trending Review Topics | As a user, I want to see trending topics in reviews, so that I can understand current discussion themes about restaurants and menu items. | The system should analyze review content to identify trending keywords, topics, or concerns. Display trending themes on restaurant pages and in analytics dashboards. Include positive and negative trending topics. |
| **FR-REVIEW-INCENTIVES-001** | Review Incentive System | As a platform admin, I want to encourage quality review writing, so that the platform has rich, helpful content for all families. | The system should implement incentives for writing detailed, helpful reviews such as badges, leaderboards, or recognition programs. Track review quality metrics and reward consistent, helpful reviewers. |
