Include engagement trends over time. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-FAMILY-005** | Dining Frequency Patterns | As a family admin, I want to understand when my family dines out most frequently, so that I can plan future dining experiences. | The system should show dining patterns by day of week, time of day (if timestamps available), and seasonal trends. Display as calendar heatmap or line charts showing activity patterns. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-FAMILY-006** | Rating Distribution Analysis | As a family admin, I want to see how my family rates restaurants on average, so that I can understand if we're generally satisfied with our dining experiences. | The system should display rating distribution charts showing how often family members give 1-10 ratings. Include average rating trends over time and comparison to platform averages. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-FAMILY-007** | Spending Insights | As a family admin, I want to estimate our dining out spending based on menu prices, so that I can track our dining budget. | The system should calculate estimated spending based on rated menu items and their prices. Display monthly spending trends, average cost per visit, and spending by cuisine type. Note: This is estimated based on rated items, not actual receipts. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-FAMILY-008** | Discovery Recommendations | As a family admin, I want to see suggested restaurants based on our family's preferences, so that I can discover new dining options we're likely to enjoy. | The system should analyze family rating patterns and suggest similar restaurants or cuisine types not yet tried. Include explanation of why each restaurant is recommended. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-RESTAURANT-001** | Restaurant Performance Overview | As a restaurant owner or platform admin, I want to see how my restaurant is performing on the platform, so that I can understand customer satisfaction and engagement. | The system should show restaurant-specific metrics including total ratings received, average rating, number of unique families who rated, and trending direction (improving/declining ratings). |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-RESTAURANT-002** | Menu Item Performance | As a restaurant owner or platform admin, I want to see which menu items are most popular and highly rated, so that I can optimize my menu offerings. | The system should display top-rated menu items, most-reviewed items, and items with declining ratings. Include suggestions for menu optimization based on rating patterns. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-RESTAURANT-003** | Customer Demographics | As a restaurant owner or platform admin, I want to understand the demographics of families who rate my restaurant, so that I can better target my marketing and menu. | The system should show family size distribution of customers, rating patterns by family type, and engagement levels. Protect individual privacy while showing aggregate patterns. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-RESTAURANT-004** | Competitive Analysis | As a restaurant owner or platform admin, I want to see how my restaurant compares to similar restaurants in the area, so that I can understand my market position. | The system should show restaurant performance compared to other restaurants in the same cuisine category or geographic area. Include rating comparisons, review volume, and market share insights. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-RESTAURANT-005** | Rating Trends Analysis | As a restaurant owner or platform admin, I want to see rating trends over time, so that I can identify patterns and respond to changes in customer satisfaction. | The system should display rating trends over selectable time periods with the ability to correlate with events (menu changes, seasons, etc.). Include alerts for significant rating changes. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-PLATFORM-001** | Platform Usage Statistics | As a platform admin, I want to see overall platform usage statistics, so that I can understand user engagement and platform growth. | The system should show total active families, total restaurants, total ratings, and growth trends. Include user acquisition, retention, and engagement metrics over time. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-PLATFORM-002** | Content Moderation Insights | As a platform admin, I want to see patterns in user-generated content, so that I can identify potential issues and maintain platform quality. | The system should show rating distribution across all restaurants, outlier detection for suspicious ratings, and content quality metrics. Include flagging for manual review of unusual patterns. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-PLATFORM-003** | Geographic Performance | As a platform admin, I want to see platform usage by geographic region, so that I can understand market penetration and identify expansion opportunities. | The system should display usage maps showing restaurant density, user activity by location, and regional growth trends. Include identification of underserved areas for expansion. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-EXPORT-001** | Data Export Functionality | As any analytics user, I want to export analytics data to external formats, so that I can perform additional analysis or share insights with stakeholders. | The system should provide export options for charts and data in formats like CSV, PDF, and PNG. Include options to export filtered data and custom date ranges. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-SCHEDULING-001** | Scheduled Reports | As a family admin or restaurant owner, I want to receive regular analytics reports, so that I can stay informed about performance without manually checking the dashboard. | The system should allow users to schedule weekly/monthly analytics reports delivered via email. Reports should include key metrics and trends with visual summaries. |
| **FR-ANALYTICS-MOBILE-001** | Mobile Analytics Access | As a mobile user, I want to access analytics dashboards on my mobile device, so that I can check insights on the go. | The analytics dashboard should be fully responsive with mobile-optimized charts and navigation. Key metrics should be easily viewable on small screens with touch-friendly interactions. |

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Requirements
