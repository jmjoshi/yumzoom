Project Requirements Document: The YumZoom Website
The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements of The YumZoom website.

Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome
---|---|---|---
FR001 | Item Rating Submission | As a customer, I want to be able to provide a rating between 1 and 10 for each item I tasted at a restaurant, so that I can record my experience. | The system should allow a logged-in user to select a restaurant, view its menu items, and submit a rating (1-10) for each item tasted.
FR002 | Family Member Rating | As a customer, I want to be able to provide rating feedback for each family member who tasted the items, so that individual preferences are recorded. | The system should allow a logged-in user to specify ratings for each menu item on behalf of different family members associated with their account.
FR003 | Retain Previous Ratings | As a logged-in user, I want to be able to see the ratings I have given before for an item when I revisit the same restaurant, so that I can recall my past experiences. | When a logged-in user views the menu of a restaurant they have previously rated items in, their past ratings for those items should be displayed.
FR004 | Secure Account Creation | As a new user, I want to be able to create an account securely with the website, so that my data is protected. | The system should provide a secure registration form requiring a unique email address and a strong password. Password storage should be encrypted.
FR005 | Collect Account Information | As a new user, during account opening, I want to provide my first name, last name, email ID, and multiple phone numbers (mobile, home, and work), so that the website has my contact information. | The account registration form should include fields for first name, last name, email ID, and allow for the entry of multiple phone numbers with labels (mobile, home, work).
FR006 | Average Item Rating | The website should be able to calculate and display the average rating for each menu item in a restaurant based on the ratings provided by all users. | For each menu item displayed, the system should calculate and show the average of all submitted ratings for that item in that specific restaurant.
FR007 | Application Administration | As an admin, I should be able to add, update and delete restaurent menu and menu items. Only administrators should be able to access the screens or web pages.
FR008 | Menu scan or upload | As an Admin, I should be able to upload restaurent menu items from a physical restaurent menu card in to the application database by scaning the menu card with a device like iPhone or android mobile phone. Once uploaded in to the application database normal user should be able to access the menu and menuitems for the ratings. The Menu and items should be saved in a database with restaurent name and its location.
