## Admin Functionality Requirements

The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements for the admin functionality

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FR-ADMIN-RESTAURANT-001** | Restaurant Creation and Management | As an admin user, I want to create new restaurants by providing restaurant name, description, address, phone number, website, cuisine type, and image URL, so that the platform has a comprehensive database of dining establishments. | The system should provide a restaurant creation form with fields for name (required), cuisine type (required), description, address, phone, website, and image URL. The restaurant should be immediately available on the public restaurants page after creation. All fields except name and cuisine type are optional. |
| **FR-ADMIN-RESTAURANT-002** | Restaurant Information Updates | As an admin user, I want to edit existing restaurant information including name, description, contact details, and cuisine type, so that restaurant data remains current and accurate. | The system should allow editing of all restaurant fields through a pre-populated form. Changes should be saved immediately and reflected on the public restaurants page. The edit form should validate required fields and URL formats. |
| **FR-ADMIN-RESTAURANT-003** | Restaurant Deletion | As an admin user, I want to delete restaurants that are no longer operating or relevant, so that the platform maintains an accurate listing of available dining options. | The system should provide a delete option with confirmation dialog warning that deletion will remove all associated menu items and ratings. Upon confirmation, the restaurant and all related data should be permanently removed from the database. |
| **FR-ADMIN-RESTAURANT-004** | Restaurant Listing and Overview | As an admin user, I want to view all restaurants in a organized grid layout with key information visible, so that I can quickly browse and manage the restaurant database. | The system should display restaurants in a responsive grid with restaurant cards showing name, cuisine type, address, contact information, and image preview. Each card should have action buttons for viewing menu items, editing, and deleting. |
| **FR-ADMIN-MENU-001** | Menu Item Creation | As an admin user, I want to add menu items to specific restaurants by providing item name, description, price, category, and image URL, so that customers can view and rate available dishes. | The system should provide a menu item creation form linked to a specific restaurant with fields for name (required), category, description, price, and image URL. Menu items should be organized by category and immediately available for rating by users. |
| **FR-ADMIN-MENU-002** | Menu Item Management | As an admin user, I want to edit and delete menu items for each restaurant, so that menus remain current with accurate pricing and descriptions. | The system should allow editing of all menu item fields through a pre-populated form. Menu items should be deletable with confirmation dialog. Changes should be reflected immediately on the public restaurant pages. |
| **FR-ADMIN-MENU-003** | Menu Category Organization | As an admin user, I want menu items to be organized by categories (Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts, etc.), so that restaurant menus are well-structured and easy to navigate. | The system should provide predefined category options in a dropdown menu. Menu items should be automatically grouped by category in both admin and public views. Categories should include: Appetizers, Salads, Soups, Main Courses, Desserts, Beverages, Sides, and Specials. |
| **FR-ADMIN-MENU-004** | Restaurant-Specific Menu Management | As an admin user, I want to access menu item management directly from the restaurant management page, so that I can efficiently manage both restaurant and menu data in a connected workflow. | Each restaurant card should have a "Menu Items" button that navigates to the menu management page for that specific restaurant. The menu management page should display the restaurant name and provide navigation back to the restaurant list. |
| **FR-ADMIN-ACCESS-001** | Admin Navigation Integration | As an admin user, I want easy access to admin functions through the main navigation, so that I can quickly access restaurant and menu management features. | The main navigation should include an "Admin" link when users are authenticated. This should provide access to the restaurant management dashboard. The admin section should be clearly distinguished from regular user features. |
| **FR-ADMIN-ACCESS-002** | Admin Interface Design | As an admin user, I want a professional and intuitive admin interface that matches the main application design, so that admin tasks can be performed efficiently and effectively. | The admin interface should use consistent design patterns with the main application including cards, buttons, forms, and typography. The interface should be fully responsive and include loading states, error handling, and success/failure notifications. |
| **FR-ADMIN-VALIDATION-001** | Form Validation and Error Handling | As an admin user, I want comprehensive form validation and clear error messages, so that I can efficiently correct data entry issues and ensure data quality. | All admin forms should validate required fields, URL formats, numeric values for prices, and provide real-time error feedback. Success and error messages should be displayed using toast notifications. Forms should prevent duplicate submissions and handle network errors gracefully. |
| **FR-ADMIN-DATA-001** | Data Persistence and Relationships | As an admin user, I want restaurant and menu item data to be properly stored and linked, so that the database maintains referential integrity and supports the full user experience. | Restaurant data should be stored in the restaurants table with proper field types. Menu items should be linked to restaurants through foreign key relationships. Deleting a restaurant should cascade delete associated menu items. All data should be immediately available to the public interface. |
| **FR-ADMIN-IMAGE-001** | Image Support and Display | As an admin user, I want to add images to restaurants and menu items through URL input, so that the platform provides visual appeal and helps users identify establishments and dishes. | Both restaurant and menu item forms should accept image URLs. Images should be displayed in admin views and public views when available. The system should handle broken image links gracefully without affecting functionality. |
| **FR-ADMIN-CUISINE-001** | Cuisine Type Management | As an admin user, I want to categorize restaurants by cuisine type using predefined options, so that users can filter and discover restaurants by their preferred food styles. | The restaurant form should provide a dropdown with cuisine types including: American, Asian, Chinese, French, Indian, Italian, Japanese, Mediterranean, Mexican, Thai, and Other. Cuisine types should be displayed on restaurant cards and used for filtering on the public restaurants page. |
| **FR-ADMIN-WORKFLOW-001** | Streamlined Admin Workflow | As an admin user, I want a logical workflow that allows me to create restaurants and immediately add menu items, so that I can efficiently build complete restaurant profiles. | After creating a restaurant, the system should provide quick access to add menu items for that restaurant. The restaurant management page should show the number of menu items per restaurant. Navigation between restaurant and menu management should be seamless and intuitive. |

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Requirements
- **restaurants table**: id, name, description, address, phone, website, cuisine_type, image_url, created_at, updated_at
- **menu_items table**: id, restaurant_id (FK), name, description, price, category, image_url, created_at, updated_at
- **Referential integrity**: Foreign key constraints with cascade delete

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Admin functions require user authentication
- **Authorization**: Future enhancement should include role-based access control
- **Input validation**: Server-side validation for all form inputs
- **SQL injection prevention**: Use parameterized queries through Supabase

### User Experience Requirements
- **Responsive design**: Admin interface works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during data operations
- **Error handling**: Graceful error messages and recovery options
- **Navigation**: Clear breadcrumbs and navigation paths
