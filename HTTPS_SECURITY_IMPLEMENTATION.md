- ‚úÖ **Security Headers**: Enhanced security headers in Next.js config
- ‚úÖ **CSP Implementation**: Content Security Policy with upgrade-insecure-requests
- ‚úÖ **HSTS Headers**: HTTP Strict Transport Security configuration
- ‚úÖ **Image Security**: Only allow HTTPS image sources

### 5. **Environment Configuration**
- ‚úÖ **Production Environment**: Created `.env.production.example` with HTTPS-only URLs
- ‚úÖ **Example Files**: Updated all environment examples to use HTTPS
- ‚úÖ **Development Setup**: Maintained HTTP for localhost development
- ‚úÖ **Security Variables**: Added HTTPS enforcement environment variables

### 6. **Testing Configuration**
- ‚úÖ **Jest Setup**: Updated test environment to use HTTPS protocol
- ‚úÖ **Mock URLs**: Updated mock configurations to use secure protocols
- ‚úÖ **Test Environment**: Ensured tests simulate HTTPS environment

### 7. **Security Validation Tools**
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS Validator**: Created comprehensive HTTPS security validation script
- ‚úÖ **Security Checks**: Added npm scripts for HTTPS security validation
- ‚úÖ **Production Readiness**: Enhanced production readiness checks

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Development
```bash
# Regular development (HTTP on localhost is fine)
npm run dev

# HTTPS development (optional, for testing HTTPS locally)
npm run dev:https
```

### For Production Deployment
```bash
# Run security validation before deployment
npm run check:https

# Run all production checks including HTTPS validation
npm run check:all

# Build for production (with HTTPS enforcement)
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables Setup

#### Development (`.env.development`)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000  # HTTP OK for localhost
```

#### Production (`.env.production`)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yumzoom.com    # HTTPS required
FORCE_HTTPS=true
HSTS_MAX_AGE=31536000
```

## üîß Configuration Details

### Automatic HTTPS Features

1. **URL Generation**: All URLs are automatically generated with HTTPS in production
2. **Redirect Middleware**: HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS
3. **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers enforce HTTPS usage
4. **CSP Protection**: Content Security Policy upgrades insecure requests
5. **HSTS Implementation**: Browser-level HTTPS enforcement with preload

### Development vs Production

| Feature | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Protocol | HTTP (localhost) | HTTPS (enforced) |
| Redirects | Disabled | HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS |
| HSTS | Disabled | Enabled |
| CSP | Relaxed | Strict HTTPS-only |
| SSL Validation | Disabled | Required |

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run `npm run check:https` - no high-severity issues
- [ ] Verify all environment variables use HTTPS URLs
- [ ] SSL certificate obtained and configured
- [ ] DNS settings point to HTTPS-enabled server

### Server Configuration
- [ ] Web server (Nginx/Apache) configured for HTTPS
- [ ] SSL certificate installed and valid
- [ ] HTTP to HTTPS redirect configured at server level
- [ ] HSTS headers enabled

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects
- [ ] Verify security headers with security testing tools
- [ ] Check SSL certificate validity
- [ ] Test all critical user flows with HTTPS

---

## üîç Security Validation

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Run HTTPS security validation
npm run check:https

# This will check for:
# - HTTP URLs in code
# - Missing security headers
# - Incorrect environment configurations
# - SSL/TLS setup issues
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Certificate Validation**: Use SSL Labs SSL Test
2. **Security Headers**: Test with securityheaders.com
3. **Mixed Content**: Check browser console for warnings
4. **Redirect Testing**: Verify HTTP automatically redirects to HTTPS

---

## üö® Important Notes

### Production Requirements
- **SSL Certificate**: Must have valid SSL certificate installed
- **Environment Variables**: All production URLs must use HTTPS protocol
- **Server Configuration**: Web server must be configured for HTTPS
- **DNS Configuration**: Domain must resolve to HTTPS-enabled server

### Security Considerations
- **HSTS Preload**: Consider adding domain to HSTS preload list
- **Certificate Renewal**: Set up automated certificate renewal
- **Mixed Content**: Ensure all external resources use HTTPS
- **API Endpoints**: All third-party integrations must support HTTPS

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Mixed Content Warnings
- **Cause**: HTTP resources loaded on HTTPS pages
- **Solution**: Update all resource URLs to HTTPS

#### Certificate Errors
- **Cause**: Invalid or expired SSL certificate
- **Solution**: Renew certificate and update server configuration

#### Redirect Loops
- **Cause**: Misconfigured server-level and application-level redirects
- **Solution**: Check both server and Next.js redirect configurations

### Getting Help
If you encounter issues:
1. Run `npm run check:https` for automated diagnostics
2. Check server logs for SSL/certificate errors
3. Verify environment variable configurations
4. Test with browser developer tools network tab

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Deploy to staging** with HTTPS configuration
2. **Test all functionality** with HTTPS enabled
3. **Run security scans** to validate implementation
4. **Update documentation** with HTTPS URLs
5. **Configure monitoring** for certificate expiration
6. **Set up automated renewal** for SSL certificates

Your YumZoom application is now properly configured for secure HTTPS communication! üîí‚ú®
