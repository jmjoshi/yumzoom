## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Environment Preparation (1-2 hours)

#### 1.1 Production Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Configure production environment variables
cp .env.production.example .env.production

# Edit .env.production with actual values:
# - Supabase production credentials
# - Domain and SSL settings
# - SMTP configuration
# - Security monitoring endpoints
# - CDN and static asset URLs

# 2. Validate environment configuration
node -e "require('dotenv').config({path: '.env.production'}); console.log('✅ Environment loaded successfully')"
```

#### 1.2 Database Preparation
```bash
# 1. Connect to production Supabase instance
# 2. Run all migration scripts in order:
# - database/schema.sql (core schema)
# - database/fix-admin-policies.sql (security policies)
# - database/add-restaurant-images.sql (content)
# - database/test-rbac.sql (test users)
# - database/social-features-schema.sql (social features)
# - database/business-platform-schema.sql (analytics)
# - database/restaurant-analytics-schema.sql (business intelligence)

# 3. Validate database setup
npm run check:database-migration
```

#### 1.3 Infrastructure Validation
```bash
# 1. Test production build
npm run build

# 2. Validate build artifacts
ls -la .next/
# Should contain: static/, server/, build-manifest.json

# 3. Test production start
npm run start
# Verify app starts on production port
```

### Step 2: Pre-Deployment Testing (2-4 hours)

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Issue 1: Build Failures
```bash
# Check TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Validate dependencies
npm audit --audit-level=moderate

# Clear build cache
rm -rf .next && npm run build
```

#### Issue 2: Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test Supabase connection
node -e "
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
supabase.from('restaurants').select('count').then(console.log);
"
```

#### Issue 3: Environment Variable Problems
```bash
# Validate all required variables are set
node scripts/validate-environment.js

# Check for missing variables
grep -r "process.env." . --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" | grep -v "NEXT_PUBLIC_" | sort | uniq
```

#### Issue 4: Performance Issues
```bash
# Run performance diagnostics
npm run check:performance

# Check database query performance
npm run check:database-migration

# Validate CDN configuration
curl -I https://cdn.your-domain.com/
```

### Emergency Rollback Procedures

#### Quick Rollback (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Switch load balancer to previous version
# 2. Monitor application health
# 3. Investigate root cause
# 4. Plan fix and re-deployment

# For Vercel/Netlify deployments:
# - Use platform rollback feature
# - Previous deployment remains available
# - Zero-downtime rollback possible
```

#### Database Rollback (15-30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Create database backup
# 2. Identify problematic migration
# 3. Revert schema changes
# 4. Restore from backup if needed
# 5. Validate application functionality
```
